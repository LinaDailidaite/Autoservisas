# Autoservice Management System 
This is my first Django project created while learning Python web development. It is a simple management system for a car service station, focusing on database relationships (Models) and clean UI design.

## What I learned:
### Django Models: Working with ForeignKeys and creating relationships between Cars, Orders, and Services.
### Calculated Fields: Implementing logic inside models to calculate total order prices and line sums.
### Problem Solving: Debugging common Python errors (like TypeError with NoneType and float) by implementing safety checks in model methods.
### Frontend Customization (HTML5 & CSS3):
#### Building a responsive layout using Bootstrap 5;
#### Implementing a custom UI with specialized typography;
#### Designing custom CSS classes to override default styles and maintain a consistent color palette across the site;

## Technologies:
### Backend:

Pillow

### Frontend:
HTML5 & CSS3
